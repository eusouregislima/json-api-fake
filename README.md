<h1> Fake API </h1>

This repository serves to publish a fake API as written in the json file.
Its purposes are only demonstrative, to interact with our Front-end.
It is possible to add, remove or edit items, but the data is not saved.

In development I recommend using json-server which does the same thing, but runs locally, and it is possible to do all the CRUD.
